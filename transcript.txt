[Music] foreign [Music] hi everybody and welcome 
to lecture six of the digital vsi design course at  
Barry lawn University I'm Dr Adam tieman and today 
we'll start moving to the physical domain of the  
vlsi design process so what's next we've basically 
finished the front end of the design process and  
we'll now start the back end of the design so 
the front end was this part over here where  
we basically just defined all the logic and how 
we're going to build our chip and how it's going  
to fit together and now we'll move to this part 
which we often call the back end the reason it  
would be called the back end is because it's more 
associated with making the metal layers I guess or  
the connections between the different cells which 
is done at the back end of the line in the design  
process versus beforehand we defined our logic 
which is associated with the transistors which  
are made at the front end of the line okay so 
to start we'll move between tools with a logical  
approach to ones with a physical approach and then 
we'll make a physical foundation for our design  
so the first thing we do is we'll drop a floor 
plan this will include making what we call big  
decisions or important pieces we'll decide where 
the they are such as the IPS that we have the  
different input output circuits the power grids 
the special routes and Etc after that we can go  
and we can place our gates when we say placement 
we're talking about placing the whole like sea of  
standard cells the whole set of these Lego pieces 
that we have in a big box different end Gates and  
end Gates and so forth and when we do that we have 
to take into consideration two things congestion  
and timing when we finish our placement now we 
have put our our flip flop somewhere so now we  
know our clocked elements are so then we can go 
on and build a clock tree see how we distribute  
the clock to every part of the design finally we 
can route our Nets or do detailed route where we  
actually go and connect all of the Nets to all 
of the pins in the different Gates and I and IPS  
we have to take into account the RCs our design 
rules and of course timing noise and other things  
finally before tape out we'll clean up things 
we'll verify we'll make sure everything is  
connected and that we are breaking no rules 
so illustratively we can look at this as such  
so our first step is we're going to move to a 
piano place in route tool or PNR tool and that  
will contain an initial floor plan like what size 
our chip is how our pad ring is made these things  
are the pad ring and for example where our core 
area where we have our standard cell rows are  
then we'll go on to power planning we 
may build some rings of vdd and ground  
for a good distribution of the power on 
the chip and bring some Stripes of power  
to bring power and ground very um a lot 
better into the standard cells themselves  
next we'll go into our placement where we're 
actually place the standard cells in the in  
the floor plan in the core area once we have 
our our design placed we have to see where our  
different flip-flops are our clocked elements 
and then we can go out and build clock trees  
which these things would be the buffers that we 
added during clock tree synthesis okay now that  
we have all of our elements basically in place we 
can go on to what we call detailed route where we  
actually go and connect Nets to every single 
part and finally we can prepare the tape out  
we can add the filler cells we can do all kinds of 
other things do checks and so forth and be ready  
to go and what we'll get in the end is something 
that looks similar to this uh picture over here
so um looking at that from a higher level I guess 
perspective we can look at what we need for moving  
to from The Logical to the physical design we 
have to Define our design that's usually a DOT  
via verilog file we have some sort of a very 
log net list that is came out of our synthesis  
we also have our SDC constraints basically 
the same SDC constraints there may be several  
modifications but they're basically the same SDC 
constraints as we had during synthesis which tell  
our tools what our optimization goals are we 
have to Define our operating conditions and  
operating modes that's mmmc and we learned all 
about that okay and we now are going into the  
physical world so we have to have Technologies in 
libraries such as left files okay finally we take  
our whole set of inputs and we Define a floor plan 
or the area that we want to put our stuff into and  
what it's going to basically look like and now we 
can go into What's called the physical design flow  
once we finish the physical design flow we'll 
get a detailed layout exported as a gds2 file
so during synthesis our world view was a 
bit idealistic we didn't care about power  
supplies we just knew that there was some sort 
of vdd in ground or one and zero but we didn't  
really care about where the power was and how 
it gets everywhere and you can see here on the  
side there's a more complex chip that there are 
different parts of the chip with different powered  
domains and and so forth maybe even the power is 
turned off in one of them so this is a much more  
complex than than we did up till now we didn't 
care about physical connections or entities we  
didn't care about clock non-idealities we always 
put that Delta skew of zero and that Delta Jitter  
and so forth is zero right therefore in order to 
start physical implementation what we have to do  
is we have to Define our Global Nets that say what 
vdd is how it actually connects to each one of the  
the cells and so forth each one of these parts 
we'll discuss later on okay we have to provide  
technology rules and sell abstracts so we have to 
tell it what the DRC rules are and what what the  
left files that include like the size of our 
cells where the actual pins are and so forth  
we have to provide physical cells these 
things were unnecessary when we were doing  
logic functionality such as filler cells that just 
filled up the empty area of the floor plan or Thai  
cells that tie gates to one or zero constants and 
so forth we have to Define hold constraints in all  
operating modes and conditions this we saw we do 
with MMC but we could have used MMC already during  
synthesis but hold was very easy to meet we had 
an ideal clock we didn't really check it we only  
checked setup now we have to do hold as well 
and we have all kinds of things like low power  
definitions such as voltage domains power Gates 
body Taps Etc this is a bit outside the context of  
this course but it is something that we have to do 
and we move to the physical domain foreign [Music]
